• What is Git and how is it different than Github
Git is a tool that you can use to code. It is mostly for personal use. It will save all your changes on a local folder. The main difference with Git and Github is that with Git all your code is stored locally in your computer, while with Github everything is saved online. Where anybody can edit it. Github is the platform you can use to collaborate in different projects. With Github there can be different versions of the same code. This way you can troubleshoot different areas and when all of these are ready to be combined you can merge the versions together. The best thing about Github is that anyone can update or improve your code. You can help out someone who is stuck on a certain step. 
• Why use the terminal
The terminal has commands that sometimes are very limited with GUI’s. You can change and edit everything through the terminal while if you were dealing with a GUI you can only do what it ask’s you for. You can use scripts, functions and conditions to modify data way faster. It is more convenient and you can automate any type of tasks. If you would want to do the same with a GUI you would have to do it manually and it would take more time. 
• Explain 3 benefits of version control in your own words
One benefit is that it allows multiple people to work on the same code. Everyone can save their own version and test it as many times as they want without affecting anybody else’s work. This is usually called a branch. Another benefit is that you can see the previous version of your code, this way if you don’t want to keep going with all the changes you made you can always go back to your older version. One last benefit of version control is that your code or project is very easy to manage with version control. You can see what each person contributed to and what changes where made by that specific user.
